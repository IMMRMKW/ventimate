# my_component1
## Todo
* Create a platform component for power delivery
	- For now, it should only have sink capability, with multiple voltage setpoints
	- Create a sensor such that actual voltage is available within your ESPHome configuration
	- The FUSB302, __init__.py should be empty, code should be moved to power_delivery.py
	- Ensure the priority of FUSB302 is set automatically if it is not explicitly set in the configuration yaml file.
* Create a complete yaml configuration that shows the working of the project
	- Find out how to discard the name of the ESPHome device in front of each sensor. This clutters the Home assistant view
* Find out how to use ESPHome stand alone
	- Create a tutorial on how to do this
* Change name of MyFan
	- Think of something!
* Change name of this project

## Inserting fan art (pun intended) in your fan
